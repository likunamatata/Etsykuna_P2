        <h2>How We Buy Vintage</h2>
        <p>In real life, I know of two mainstream ways in which you can get your hands on vintage clothes--
          you can buy loads of it by the pound or you can go to small shops to purchase individual pieces.
          In both cases, you will most likely end up finding only a handful of items that meet your criteria
          in terms of design, materials, fit, etc. and intuitively, the monetary per-good-find cost of the first
           option is lower. On the other hand, shopping in small boutiquesque establishments comes with the
           markup component that covers the cost of curation and branding. The latter is nothing more than
           outsourcing the task of going through piles of unpromising old rags to find some unique gems that
           will get you complimented at work, in school, and even on the street.

        <h2>What Makes It A Good Experience</h2>
        <p>Just kidding, in my humble opinion, it takes a great deal of taste and talent to find good vintage
          and most vintage shop curators/buyers are way better at it than the general public, not to mention
          the whole concept of branding and boutique experience. Curating vintage requires much more than time
           and  especially important components are taste and customer service. Some good physical examples to
            demonstrate my point are Olly Oxen Free Vintage (previously Brooklyn, now on Etsy),
            Vintageria Venezia (Venice, Italy), and every other vintage shop in Budapest. These are a
         few things that make my shopping experience there extremely enjoyable: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Everything on their racks has been put together by people with great sense for
            timeless beauty and quality materials (rather than what's trendy now in this exact
            moment and over-worn by the majority of people in my demographic)</li>
          <li>The atmosphere feels like the costume room of an old theater and the clothes too are
            part of the interior
          </li>
          <li>Sales associates, who are often owners themselves, are friendly and happy to develop
            relationships with their recurring customers, which includes picking up on your taste and
            letting you know when something up your alley just got put on a racks
            </li>
          <li>Even though all these shops are unique and decentralized, there seems to be a global
            unwritten system of organizing -- in all the vintage shops I've been at, everything is
            organized by size, by color, or by combination of both
          </li>
          <li>
            After a series of successful purchases, I'm able to start trusting them enough to let these
              shops dictate my choices, so in some way, I start liking things just because I found it there
          </li>
          <li> In addition to being of good taste and high quality, the choices are limited by space and labor
            ize (buyers), so it’s easy to browse through all the options and find pieces I wouldn't have
            specifically searched for myself (going back to the previous point)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Is Doing It Right Online</h2>
        <p>Now that all retail  is going online, it's interesting to observe who has succeeded and who
          is lagging behind on digitizing the vintage shopping experience. Loosely regulated marketplaces
          like Ebay and Etsy are great tools for individuals and small businesses to get started online,
          allowing them to concentrate on what they do best (sourcing and branding vintage) instead of dealing
          with the logistics of online selling. However, it's incredibly hard to navigate these websites as
          a user because anyone can start a shop and upload endless amount of products unconstrained by "rack
          size" and retail space rent (i.e., survival of the chicest both for clothing pieces and for the shops).
          For this reason, the real-deal vintage sellers will usually sell via Instagram DM's or have individual
          websites and I have a feeling there are more important reasons than avoiding the E-market commission.
          "Portland vintage queens" aka I AM THAT shop and Floridian Ivia Retro are two online vintagers who
          have digitized almost all of my favorite parts of the experience:
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All pieces listed are of great taste and quality
          </li>
          <li>Website designs are clean and aesthetically pleasing
          </li>
          <li>As online shops selling worldwide, it'd be hard for them to form personal relationships with
            customers, but they make up for it by maintaining good social media presence where they both
            advertise their products and create their brand personality</li>
          <li>
            Their listings are organized in an extremely simple and intuitive framework  making it easy to browse
                (clothing category, size, price)
          </li>
          <li> I trust their taste more than mine, I've bought many seemingly quirky things just because
            I saw them in these two shops and all of these clothes turned out to be amazing in action
          </li>
          <li>The choices are not endless - each shop has under 10 categories and 100-150 total listings at a time
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recreating These Best Practices For Etsy Vendors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Curation of the curated</h3>
            <p>Make it easier to find the Etsy shops that have already gotten it right (.e.g., AKV).
            This can be achieved by spending more time on social features of the website like the '/people/username'
            path where my followers can see favorited shops and items. It's been live for a long time, but not a lot of
            people know or care about it because it just doesn't look nice and can be confusing at times. I don't know who to follow
            to see their favorite shops and even if I did, it wouldn't look fun with the whole ebay-esque white
            background and no options to decorate the profile (e.g., with the cover image). </p></li>
          <li><h3>Limiting unlimited choices - Etsykuna example</h3><p>
            After making sellers more discoverable, it's cruicial to make them and their items easily accessible on a regular basis.
            This can be achieved with something as simple as creating small rooms of select stores as
          demonstrated by Etsykuna while making the list of the shops customizable. Currently, I can
          do something similar by going to my favorite shops list and then going into the shops one by
          one but it takes a lot of clicking back and forth. The process of isolating certain parts of
          the large market needs to be smoothed out so that Etsy can maintain its inclusivity and
          customizability for the benefit of unique small businesses, while also making it easy for
          shoppers to find what they need in their respective pocket of the website. This would be a
          much better solution than the recommendation algorithms especially when it comes to vintage
          fashion. Not only the algorithms don't seem to be helpful in finding the items I often search
          for, their operating model is that they pick up on trends (mine or general) retrospectively so
          they keep recommending the types of things that I already viewed or were already purchased by a
           lot of people which is the opposite of what I need when looking for tastefully unique and
           non-cliché vintage clothes. Even if the algorithms were to become so sophisticated that they
           replace human vintage curators, they would still not be enough as the problem is not just what
           you show me first, but also how many options you let me choose out of. Many behavioral economists
           including the OG Richard Thaler have explained that choice overload may be more constraining than
           freeing for people and that the organizations/businesses who see and address this problem get
           better engagement. I read Thaler's Nudge a while ago and don't remember the exact examples he
           used but he described the importance of choice architecture in the context of healthcare. In
           regards with vintage shopping, curating and also limiting my choices not only helps me find the
           right items but also gets me to the checkout way faster as I don't get sucked into the analysis
           paralysis. </p></li>
          <li><h3>Corporate-style Sales Enablement</h3>
            <p>while decreasing the barrier to entry in the market is amazing,
              having people enter with no or limited means of performing in it is something
              that can be improved if addressed collectively. I think it would be great to support interested Etsy sellers
              with general and customized sales effectiveness guidelines to help position them well in terms
              of organizing their online spaces, setting prices, and managing inventory. Even the well-established sellers could benefit from it. 
              For example, Persephone Vintage has over 150K and 50K followers on Instagram and Etsy respectively, yet somehow I've been
              looking at a few of their beautiful dresses that still haven't been sold for over a YEAR -- maybe with a little help they can get the prices right
              and let them go (to my closet)?

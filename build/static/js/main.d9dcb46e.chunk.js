On the other hand, shopping in small boutiquesque establishments comes with the markup component that covers the cost of curation and branding.

Loosely regulated marketplaces like Ebay and Etsy are great tools for individuals and small businesses to get started online, allowing them to concentrate on what they do best (sourcing and branding vintage) instead of dealing with the logistics of online selling. However, it\'s incredibly hard to navigate these websites as a user because anyone can start a shop and upload endless amount of products unconstrained by "rack size" and retail space rent (i.e., survival of the chicest both for clothing pieces and for the shops). For this reason, the real-deal vintage sellers will usually sell via Instagram DM\'s or have individual websites and I have a feeling there are more important reasons than avoiding the E-market commission.

This can be achieved with something as simple as creating small rooms of select stores as demonstrated by Etsykuna while making the list of the shops customizable. Currently, I can do something similar by going to my favorite shops list and then going into the shops one by one but it takes a lot of clicking back and forth. The process of isolating certain parts of the large market needs to be smoothed out so that Etsy can maintain its inclusivity and customizability for the benefit of unique small businesses, while also making it easy for shoppers to find what they need in their respective pocket of the website. This would be a much better solution than the recommendation algorithms especially when it comes to vintage fashion. Not only the algorithms don't seem to be helpful in finding the items I often search for, their operating model is that they pick up on trends (mine or general) retrospectively so they keep recommending the types of things that I already viewed or were already purchased by a lot of people which is the opposite of what I need when looking for tastefully unique and non-clich\xe9 vintage clothes. Even if the algorithms were to become so sophisticated that they replace human vintage curators, they would still not be enough as the problem is not just what you show me first, but also how many options you let me choose out of. Many behavioral economists including the OG Richard Thaler have explained that choice overload may be more constraining than freeing for people and that the organizations/businesses who see and address this problem get better engagement. I read Thaler's Nudge a while ago and don't remember the exact examples he used but he described the importance of choice architecture in the context of healthcare. In regards with vintage shopping, curating and also limiting my choices not only helps me find the right items but also gets me to the checkout way faster as I don't get sucked into the analysis paralysis.

I think it would be great to support interested Etsy sellers with general and customized sales effectiveness guidelines to help position them well in terms of organizing their online spaces, setting prices, and managing inventory. Even the well-established sellers could benefit from it.

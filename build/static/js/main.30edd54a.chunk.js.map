know of two mainstream ways in which you can get your hands on vintage clothes--\n          you can buy loads of it by the pound or you can go to small shops to purchase individual pieces.\n          In both cases, you will most likely end up finding only a handful of items that meet your criteria\n          in terms of design, materials, fit, etc. and intuitively, the monetary per-good-find cost of the first\n           option is lower. On the other hand, shopping in small boutiquesque establishments comes with the\n           markup component that covers the cost of curation and branding. The latter is nothing more than\n           outsourcing the task of going through piles of unpromising old rags to find some unique gems that\n           will get you complimented at work, in school, and even on the street.\n    </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className='notesSection'>\n        <h2>What Makes It A Good Experience</h2>\n        <p>Just kidding, in my humble opinion, it takes a great deal of taste and talent to find good vintage\n          and most vintage shop curators/buyers are way better at it than the general public, not to mention\n          the whole concept of branding and boutique experience. Curating vintage requires much more than time\n           and  especially important components are taste and customer service. Some good physical examples to\n            demonstrate my point are Olly Oxen Free Vintage (previously Brooklyn, now on Etsy),\n            Vintageria Venezia (Venice, Italy), and every other vintage shop in Budapest. These are a\n         few things that make my shopping experience there extremely enjoyable: </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Everything on their racks has been put together by people with great sense for\n            timeless beauty and quality materials (rather than what's trendy now in this exact\n            moment and over-worn by the majority of people in my demographic)</li>\n          <li>The atmosphere feels like the costume room of an old theater and the clothes too are\n            part of the interior\n          </li>\n          <li>Sales associates, who are often owners themselves, are friendly and happy to develop\n            relationships with their recurring customers, which includes picking up on your taste and\n            letting you know when something up your alley just got put on a racks\n            </li>\n          <li>Even though all these shops are unique and decentralized, there seems to be a global\n            unwritten system of organizing -- in all the vintage shops I've been at, everything is\n            organized by size, by color, or by combination of both\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            After a series of successful purchases, I'm able to start trusting them enough to let these\n              shops dictate my choices, so in some way, I start liking things just because I found it there\n          </li>\n          <li> In addition to being of good taste and high quality, the choices are limited by space and labor\n            ize (buyers), so it’s easy to browse through all the options and find pieces I wouldn't have\n            specifically searched for myself (going back to the previous point)\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div className='notesSection'>\n        <h2>Who Is Doing It Right Online</h2>\n        <p>Now that all retail  is going online, it's interesting to observe who has succeeded and who\n          is lagging behind on digitizing the vintage shopping experience. Loosely regulated marketplaces\n          like Ebay and Etsy are great tools for individuals and small businesses to get started online,\n          allowing them to concentrate on what they do best (sourcing and branding vintage) instead of dealing\n          with the logistics of online selling. However, it's incredibly hard to navigate these websites as\n          a user because anyone can start a shop and upload endless amount of products unconstrained by \"rack\n          size\" and retail space rent (i.e., survival of the chicest both for clothing pieces and for the shops).\n          For this reason, the real-deal vintage sellers will usually sell via Instagram DM's or have individual\n          websites and I have a feeling there are more important reasons than avoiding the E-market commission.\n          \"Portland vintage queens\" aka I AM THAT shop and Floridian Ivia Retro are two online vintagers who\n          have digitized almost all of my favorite parts of the experience:\n          </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>All pieces listed are of great taste and quality\n          </li>\n          <li>Website designs are clean and aesthetically pleasing\n          </li>\n          <li>As online shops selling worldwide, it'd be hard for them to form personal relationships with\n            customers, but they make up for it by maintaining good social media presence where they both\n            advertise their products and create their brand personality</li>\n          <li>\n            Their listings are organized in an extremely simple and intuitive framework  making it easy to browse\n                (clothing category, size, price)\n          </li>\n          <li> I trust their taste more than mine, I've bought many seemingly quirky things just because\n            I saw them in these two shops and all of these clothes turned out to be amazing in action\n          </li>\n          <li>The choices are not endless - each shop has under 10 categories and 100-150 total listings at a time\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div className='notesSection'>\n        <h2>Recreating These Best Practices For Etsy Vendors</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><h3>Curation of the curated</h3>\n            <p>Make it easier to find the Etsy shops that have already gotten it right (.e.g., AKV).\n            This can be achieved by spending more time on social features of the website like the '/people/username'\n            path where my followers can see favorited shops and items. It's been live for a long time, but not a lot of\n            people know or care about it because it just doesn't look nice and can be confusing at times. I don't know who to follow\n            to see their favorite shops and even if I did, it wouldn't look fun with the whole ebay-esque white\n            background and no options to decorate the profile (e.g., with the cover image). </p></li>\n          <li><h3>Limiting unlimited choices - Etsykuna example</h3><p>\n            After making sellers more discoverable, it's cruicial to make them and their items easily accessible on a regular basis.\n            This can be achieved with something as simple as creating small rooms of select stores as\n          demonstrated by Etsykuna while making the list of the shops customizable. Currently, I can\n          do something similar by going to my favorite shops list and then going into the shops one by\n          one but it takes a lot of clicking back and forth. The process of isolating certain parts of\n          the large market needs to be smoothed out so that Etsy can maintain its inclusivity and\n          customizability for the benefit of unique small businesses, while also making it easy for\n          shoppers to find what they need in their respective pocket of the website. This would be a\n          much better solution than the recommendation algorithms especially when it comes to vintage\n          fashion. Not only the algorithms don't seem to be helpful in finding the items I often search\n          for, their operating model is that they pick up on trends (mine or general) retrospectively so\n          they keep recommending the types of things that I already viewed or were already purchased by a\n           lot of people which is the opposite of what I need when looking for tastefully unique and\n           non-cliché vintage clothes. Even if the algorithms were to become so sophisticated that they\n           replace human vintage curators, they would still not be enough as the problem is not just what\n           you show me first, but also how many options you let me choose out of. Many behavioral economists\n           including the OG Richard Thaler have explained that choice overload may be more constraining than\n           freeing for people and that the organizations/businesses who see and address this problem get\n           better engagement. I read Thaler's Nudge a while ago and don't remember the exact examples he\n           used but he described the importance of choice architecture in the context of healthcare. In\n           regards with vintage shopping, curating and also limiting my choices not only helps me find the\n           right items but also gets me to the checkout way faster as I don't get sucked into the analysis\n           paralysis. </p></li>\n          <li><h3>Corporate-style Sales Enablement</h3>\n            <p>while decreasing the barrier to entry in the market is amazing,\n              having people enter with no or limited means of performing in it is something\n              that can be improved if addressed collectively. I think it would be great to support interested Etsy sellers\n              with general and customized sales effectiveness guidelines to help position them well in terms\n              of organizing their online spaces, setting prices, and managing inventory. Even the well-established sellers could benefit from it. \n              For example, Persephone Vintage has over 150K and 50K followers on Instagram and Etsy respectively, yet somehow I've been\n              looking at a few of their beautiful dresses that still haven't been sold for over a YEAR -- maybe with a little help they can get the prices right\n              and let them go (to my closet)?\n            </p></li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n\n\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Notes;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport axios from 'axios';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nconst CORS = `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`;\nconst API_KEY = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;\nconst LISTINGS_URL = `https://openapi.etsy.com/v2/listings/`;\nconst API_PREFACE = `?includes=MainImage&&api_key=`;\n\nclass ProductDetail extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      listingId: props.listingId,\n      loaded: false\n    }\n  }\n  componentDidMount = async () => {\n    const listingData = await axios.get(CORS + LISTINGS_URL + this.state.listingId + API_PREFACE + API_KEY)\n    this.setState({\n      listingData: listingData,\n      loaded: true\n    })\n  }\n  render() {\n    let listingObject = '';\n    if (this.state.loaded == false) {\n      return (\n        <div className='loadingMessage'>\n          <p className='loadingText'>Thank you for your patience while we load the data</p>\n          <iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/oVtYtD1k0SSDivz4rS\" className=\"loadingImage\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    else {\n      listingObject = this.state.listingData.data.results[0]\n    }\n    return (\n      <div className='productDetail'>\n        <img src={listingObject.MainImage.url_fullxfull} className='largePic'\n          alt='Product Pic' />\n        <div className='detailText'>\n          <h2 className='detailTitle'>{listingObject.title}</h2>\n          <a>{`$${listingObject.price}`}</a>\n          <a href={listingObject.url}>\n            <button>Buy on Etsy</button>\n          </a>\n          <p className='detailDescription'>{listingObject.description}</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\nexport default ProductDetail;","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Header from './components/basic/Header.js';\nimport ListingsContainer from './components/ListingsContainer.js';\nimport { Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Home from './components/basic/Home.js';\nimport Notes from './components/basic/Notes.js';\nimport ProductDetail from './components/ProductDetail.js';\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Header />\n      <Route exact path='/'>\n        <Home />\n      </Route>\n\n      <Route exact path='/Browse'>\n        <ListingsContainer />\n      </Route>\n\n      <Route path={\"/Browse/:listing_id\"}\n        render={props =>\n          <ProductDetail\n            listingId={props.match.params.listing_id}\n          />\n        } />\n\n      <Route path='/Notes'>\n        <Notes />\n      </Route>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Router className='router'>\n    <App />\n  </Router>, document.getElementById('root'));\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

### Etsykuna (aka Mini Etsy)

This app allows me to create a funky-looking online space where I can browse the listings of my favorite Etsy vintage sellers in limited quantities (max 300 items at a time). The main goal of the design is to digitize the real life vintage shopping experience. That is, small eclectic space with a small amount of highly curated options that guarantees quick and good purchases and also makes the process of buying enjoyable. Different screens of the web app are intentionally simple to make the product facts and data easily digestible and increase the likelyhood of shopper engagement. Once the user decides to buy an item, there is a link to its actual Etsy listing where the purchase can be processed.

To quickly check out what the app looks like, you can visit

* MVP: Etsy listings from 5 of my favorite shops
* Post-MVP: Add pages so only 50 items get loaded each time instead of all 0-300 in one page
* Post-Post-MVP: Add a back-end functionality where I can save users' login data and their 5 favorite shops(instead of the current list predetemined by me)


## Project History and Process:
* You can view the initial wireframes and component hierarchy here https://marvelapp.com/di006e0
* API source: I used Etsy API as my data source.
* Size of displayed data: Since Etsy only returns max of 100 items per API request, I'm requesting 3 batches of 100-items to load all of my data. Choosing 300 as the maximum number of items for my app is a personal preference of how many product listings I want to browse through at a time. Two of my favorite online shops I AM THAT and Ivia Retro max it out at 100-150 and most organized and curated Etsy vintage sellers don't have more than 300 items at a time in their shop.
